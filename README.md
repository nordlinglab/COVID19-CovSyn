# COVID19-CovSyn

Repository for the code of the COVID-19 Data Synthesis project

## Overview

CovSyn, an innovative tool that generates comprehensive synthetic data at the individual level, encompassing demographic characteristics (age, gender, occupation), course of disease (infection dates, symptom onset, recovery dates), and contact tracing information (daily social interactions including household, school, workplace, healthcare, and municipality).

To run our code, we recommend you follow the following steps:

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Miniconda
3. Create and activate the conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n "covsyn" python=3.10.11
   conda activate covsyn
   ```
4. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd CovSyn
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
    

## Usage

The simulation pipeline consists of three main stages:

### 1. Initial Parameter Setting

Run `All_parameters_for_data_synthesis.ipynb` to generate the required initial parameters and search boundaries for the Taiwan main island simulation.

### 2. Parameter Optimization (Optional)

Run the firefly optimization algorithm to find optimal simulation parameters:
```bash
python firefly_optimizer.py
```
This will generate optimized parameter files in `firefly_result/Firefly_result_pop_size_100_alpha_1_betamin_1_gamma_0.131_max_generations_200/`.

### 3. Data Synthesis

Run the main data synthesis script:
```bash
./data_synthesis.sh
```
Note: We recommend Windows users to use Git Bash to run this script.

   - Probability of contact
   - Consecutive daily contact probability
   - Contact probability when healthy
   - Contact probability when symptomatic
   - Steepness of logistic contact probability function
   - Phase relative to symptom onset for symptomatic
   - Phase relative to symptom onset for resuming normal social context
